# Note to self, look into:

- **Custom Domain:** You can add a `CNAME` file with just tne name of a domain you own and then [set up your DNS](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/) to point to this repository's site.
- **Jekyll Blog:** GitHub only serves static files on these sites so you can't put a server (PHP/Rails/Node) application here. You can however, use the static site generator, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), which is supported by GitHub pages, to generate a blog or site. There are Jekyll sites you can fork to start with, too, like [Poole](http://markdotto.com/2014/01/02/introducing-poole/).
